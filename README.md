# hello-world
My first repository

I could say I'm excited to join Github and create my first repository, but honestly it just makes me wish more that I already knew all this and could be able to code stuff out and understand things better in the snap of a finger. I might also not be too excited because it's nearly 2:30 in the morning and I'm a bit tired. 

Yeah, I'm an overthinker. And not in a good way.
